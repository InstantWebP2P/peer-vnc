These work just \nlike \"raw 16\" and \"raw 32\" except they are node buffers instead of strings.\n\n    buffer 16  11011000  0xd8\n    buffer 32  11011001  0xd9\n\nAlso I've added a type for `undefined` that works just like the `null` type.\n\n    undefined  11000100  0xc4\n\n## Usage\n\n``` javascript\nvar msgpack = require('msgpack');\nvar assert = require('assert');\n\nvar initial = {Hello: \"World\"};\nvar encoded = msgpack.encode(initial);\nvar decoded = msgpack.decode(encoded);\n\nassert.deepEqual(initial, decoded);\n```\n\n",
